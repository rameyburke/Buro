# Buro - Agile Project Management Application
#
# This is a FastAPI-based backend for a Jira-like agile project management system.
# The application implements core agile concepts including Epics, User Stories,
# Tasks, and Bugs with Kanban board functionality.
#
# Educational Notes for Junior Developers:
# - FastAPI chosen over Flask/Django: Excellent async support, automatic API docs,
#   strong type validation with Pydantic. Tradeoff: Steeper learning curve vs.
#   mature ecosystem and performance optimization.
# - SQLAlchemy over Django ORM: More flexible query building, better async support.
#   Tradeoff: More verbose for simple CRUD vs. developer productivity.

# Configuration file
# Stores sensitive data separately from code following security best practices
# Why python-decouple: Simple environment variable loading.
# Tradeoff: Less feature-rich than pydantic-settings vs. zero-configuration setup.
